CapyVAE is a lightweight Transformer library originally developed for the [ModularLegs project](https://modularlegs.github.io/) by Chen Yu. The code is now being separated from the main codebase ([modularlegs GitHub repository](https://github.com/Chenaah/modularlegs)) to create an easy-to-use Transformer library.

Stay tuned for future releases and documentation!
